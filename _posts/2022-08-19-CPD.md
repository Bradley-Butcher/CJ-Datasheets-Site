CPD contains information on ~ 35,000 officers in the Chicago Police Department. The raw data was obtained via Freedom of Information requests. Each officer instance reports on demographics and period of service. Complaint instances contain information on the allegation, the officer involved, the result of the investigation and following sanctions. Information about unit assignments, tactical actions, and officer salaries and awards is also available.
