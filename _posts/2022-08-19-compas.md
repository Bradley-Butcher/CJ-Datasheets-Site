COMPAS is a predictive tool used by judges and parole officers. The tool produces an automated risk score to predict the probability of re-offending within a specific time frame. In 2016, ProPublica released a studyand an accompanying dataset of ~ 10,000 in obtained from Broward County, Florida. The dataset included the COMPAS risk scores and any reported re-offending in the two year period following the original arrest. The study concluded that the COMPAS tool is racially biased, but follow-up research challenged this conclusion. The COMPAS dataset was extended (not by the original creators) in 2020 to include probation data from the Broward County Clerkâ€™s Office.
