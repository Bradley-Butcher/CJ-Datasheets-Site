JUSTFAIR is a database of criminal sentencing decisions from Federal district courts. There are over 570,000 records from the years 2001 â€“ 2018, complied from several public sources. Each record contains information about defendants' demographics, crimes they are charged with and corresponding sentences, and the identity of the sentencing judge. The creators plan to extend this dataset to include state-level sentencing in the future.
