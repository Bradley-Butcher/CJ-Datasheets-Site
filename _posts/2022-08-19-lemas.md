A periodic survey collecting data on law enforcement agencies, conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The latest cohort, 2016, includes over 3,000 agencies, including all agencies with 100 or more full-time officers and a sample of smaller agencies. Data includes information on the number and demographic composition of officers and civilian employees, salaries, computer systems, and vehicles, as well as information on policies regarding weapons and armor, education, training and community policing. The 2016 LEMAS contains a Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) supplement, with responses from 3,928 agencies with and without BWCs.
