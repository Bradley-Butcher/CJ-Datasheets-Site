A national annual survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. A representative sample of ~ 240,000 people are asked whether they were victims of criminal behavior.  NCVS collects information on personal crimes (e.g., rape, assault, and robbery) and property crimes (e.g., burglary and theft). If an incident occurred, the respondents provide information about the offender as well as characteristics of the crime and whether the crime was reported to the police.
