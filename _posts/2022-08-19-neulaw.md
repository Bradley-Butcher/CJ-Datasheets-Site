  - Criminal Charges & Court Records
---

A database that contains millions of court records from 1977 to 2014 from Harris County in Texas, New York City, and Miami-Dade County in Florida. Each record reports the defendant's demographics, the offenses they are charged with, and the progress of the case from charge to disposition. The Harris County data includes anonymized identifiers that enable the construction of a partial criminal record (containing only charges pressed within Harris County).
