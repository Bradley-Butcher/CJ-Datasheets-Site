The main program of data collections from law enforcement agencies in the US. Through NIBRS, the FBI collects incident-level data on crime from law enforcement agencies, where an incident is defined as a set of offenses committed by a group of individuals, at the same time and place. NIBRS reports detailed information on each recorded crime incident. Both offender and victim demographics are reported, as well as relationships between victims and offenders. It is reported whether an arrest was made and the type of arrest (e.g. on view). Information on property and weapons involved in the crime is also available, as well as the time of day and type of location (e.g., street) the crime occurred in. Not all law enforcement agencies report to NIBRS, but participation is growing, and there is complete population coverage for some states.
