A source of standardized data on vehicle and pedestrian stops from law enforcement departments. The data is not comprehensive, i.e., not all stops are included, but it contains over 200 million records from the majority of state patrol agencies and over 50 police departments. Data was obtained via public records requests. The project is maintained by researchers and journalists at Stanford University. Records contain all or some of the following: date and time of the stop, the reason for the stop, demographics of the individual stopped, and outcome (e.g. arrest, warning, and citation).
