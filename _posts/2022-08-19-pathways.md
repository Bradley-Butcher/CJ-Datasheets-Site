A project that followed 1,354 serious juvenile offenders from adolescence to young adulthood. Participants between the ages of 14 and 18 years old were enrolled, each found guilty of a serious offense. Each participant was followed for a period of seven years, with interviews conducted every 6 months for the first 3 years and every 12 months thereafter. In addition, official arrest and court records were obtained for each participant. Among other topics, participants were asked about their offending, interactions with the justice system, and alcohol and drug use.
