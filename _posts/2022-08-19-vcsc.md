VCSC followed 22,986 adult defendants charged with a criminal offense in October 2017.[^1] Each case was tracked until final disposition or December 31, 2018, whichever came sooner. 700 variables are reported for each entry, including demographics, pending and current charges, probation status, release status and bond (when applicable), standardized criminal history, and predicted risk level. Additional charges, arrests and convictions during the follow-up period are also reported.
