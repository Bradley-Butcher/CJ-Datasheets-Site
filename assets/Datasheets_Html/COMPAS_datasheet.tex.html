<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p><em>The Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS)</em> is a predictive tool used by judges and parole officers. The tool produces an automated risk score to predict the probability of re-offending within a specific time frame. In 2016, ProPublica released a study <span class="citation" data-cites="angwin2016machine"></span> and an accompanying dataset obtained from Broward County, Florida. The aim of the study was to investigate whether there was any racial bias in the COMPAS tool.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>This dataset was produced by Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, Lauren Kirchner and Julia Angwin for ProPublica.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>Previous studies have investigated the efficacy of U.S. risk assessment algorithms, including COMPAS <span class="citation" data-cites="brennan2009evaluating"></span>. However, there were no recent datasets published containing COMPAS scores and associated re-offending data.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each instance of the COMPAS dataset corresponds to an individual that has been assessed by the COMPAS system.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains 11,757 individuals who were assigned a risk score by the COMPAS tool during pre-trial.</p>

For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains all individuals who were screened by the COMPAS tool in Broward County between 2013 – 2014.</p>

If there is a large number of variables, please provide a broad description of what is included.</span></h2>
<p>Each instance consists of the following variables:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Offender age</p></li>
<li><p>Offender age at first offense</p></li>
<li><p>Race of offender</p></li>
<li><p>Gender of offender</p></li>
<li><p>Jail history</p></li>
<li><p>Prison history</p></li>

Please include labels that are likely to be used as target labels, e.g. recidivism.</span></h2>
<p>There are two target labels: ‘COMPAS score’ and ‘recidivist’. COMPAS score can also further be grouped into Low, Medium, and High. Scores 1 to 4 were labeled by COMPAS as “Low”; 5 to 7 were labeled “Medium”; and 8 to 10 were labeled “High.”</p>

If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?</span></h2>
<p>There are a few important things to keep in mind when using this dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Potential Incorrect Data Entry</strong>: The ProPublica authors note: "We found that sometimes people’s names or dates of birth were incorrectly entered in some records".</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conclusion the dataset contains racial bias is disputed</strong>: There are a number of critics of the paper which this dataset is from. Criticisms can be categorized into (1) not using the same set of variables Northpointe used to compute the COMPAS score, (2) incorrect modelling assumptions <span class="citation" data-cites="Rudin2020Age"></span>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Only uses local charges</strong>: The dataset uses charges in the Broward County database, which only contains the local charges. If criminal history exists outside this, it is not captured. Additionally, if re-offending occurs outside the county, it will not be counted as recidivism.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recidivism timer starts at screening</strong>: "we defined recidivism as a new arrest within two years" (of screening). If an offender is taken into custody, they will have less opportunity to re-offend, biasing the results.</p></li>
