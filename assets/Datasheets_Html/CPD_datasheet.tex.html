<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The original raw data files were sought by J. Kalven, a journalist in the City of Chicago, as part of his investigation into police abuse. After the original FOIA requests and legal case, the non-profit Invisible Institute (<a href="https://invisible.institute">https://invisible.institute</a>) began to collaborate with Kalven and the University of Chicago’s Mandel Legal Aid Clinic to follow up on earlier FOIA requests and to file new ones. The data disclosed in response to these earlier and now ongoing FOIA requests were made available online as part of the Citizens Police Data Project.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-and-on-behalf-of-which-entity">Who created the dataset, and on behalf of which entity?</h2>
<p>The Chicago Police Department (CPD), Civilian Office of Police Accountability (COPA), and the City of Chicago produced the raw data files in response to FOIA requests. The raw data were curated and released publicly by the Invisible Institute and its collaborators. The cleaned and linked data were produced as part of research by the authors of this document.</p>
<h2 id="who-funded-the-creation-of-the-dataset">Who funded the creation of the dataset?</h2>
<p>The acquisition of the original raw data was funded by the Invisible Institute.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent?</h2>
<p>There are multiple types of instance in this data.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Officer: information about an individual police officer</p></li>
<li><p>Unit assignment: a single unit assignment for an officer</p></li>
<li><p>Complaint: a complaint filed against a police officer, either internally or by a civilian</p></li>
<li><p>Tactical Response Report: a form that an officer is required to fill out after their response requires use of force</p></li>
<li><p>Award request: a request to grant an award to an officer</p></li>
<li><p>Salary: a record of an officer’s salary, pay grade, and position across multiple years</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type">How many instances are there in total (of each type)?</h2>
<p>There are roughly 35,000 unique officers in the cleaned roster appearing in roughly 130,000 profiles throughout the data, 730,000 award request records, 194,000 salary records, 108,000 unit assignment records, 109,000 complaints, and 10,500 tactical response reports.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-of-instances-from-a-larger-set">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample of instances from a larger set?</h2>
<p>This data contains information regarding all sworn officers in the Chicago Police Department / City of Chicago databases for the stated date ranges (which differ for each source of raw data).</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of">What data does each instance consist of?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Officer: officer unique ID, race, gender, age, appointment date, resignation date, badge number(s), position title(s)</p></li>
<li><p>Unit assignment: officer unique ID, start date, end date, unit number</p></li>
<li><p>Complaint: complaint ID, involved officer IDs, allegation, result of the investigation, resulting sanction (where available)</p></li>
<li><p>Tactical Response Report: report ID, event location, date, and time, environmental conditions, who was notified, weapons discharged, weapon information, subject demographic information</p></li>
<li><p>Award Request: awardee unique ID, requester, request date, award reference number, award type, request tracking number, incident dates, ceremony date</p></li>
<li><p>Salary: officer unique ID, salary, position title, pay grade, year</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-there-a-label-or-target-associated-with-each-instance">Is there a label or target associated with each instance?</h2>
<p>Not explicitly. However, labels could be constructed from the data that exists. For example, one could aggregate complaints to produce an integer “number of complaints” for each officer in the data, and use that as the response variable in a prediction task.</p>
<h2 id="is-any-information-missing-from-individual-instances">Is any information missing from individual instances?</h2>
<p>In the original raw data files, missing data (of all fields) is quite common (see Appendix D in <span class="citation" data-cites="horel2021the"></span>). In the cleaned and linked data files, we are able to aggregate multiple profiles of a single officer appearing throughout the data to “fill in the gaps,” although this process is not perfect and there are still missing entries.</p>
<h2 id="are-relationships-between-individual-instances-made-explicit">Are relationships between individual instances made explicit?</h2>
<p>In the raw data, no. In the cleaned data, we provide a unique officer identification that enables linking the activities and records regarding individual officers across datasets. There is no relational data (i.e., network edges) explicitly contained in the data. However, it is possible to use the data to construct a network, e.g., by linking officers co-listed on complaints.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-recommended-data-splits">Are there recommended data splits?</h2>
<p>No, although the officer database is likely to be incomplete prior to roughly 1980.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-any-errors-sources-of-noise-or-redundancies-in-the-dataset">Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?</h2>
<p>There are redundancies in the raw data, but these are removed by our cleaning and linking procedure. Errors, inconsistencies, and missing data are also present in the raw data; our cleaning and linking resolves much of these issues. However, per Section 4 in <span class="citation" data-cites="horel2021the"></span>, the officer database is likely to be incomplete prior to roughly 1980 (as officers were added to the database only gradually over time).</p>
<h2 id="is-the-dataset-self-contained-or-does-it-rely-on-external-resources">Is the dataset self-contained, or does it rely on external resources?</h2>
<p>The dataset is self-contained: the raw data itself is stored in the <code>raw/</code> folder of the repository (with links to the external source files for reference), and the cleaned/linked data is produced by the source code in the repository.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-that-might-be-considered-confidential">Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential?</h2>
<p>No; all of this data was publicly released as part of FOIA requests. Confidential data (e.g., relating to under cover officers) was withheld by the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-that-if-viewed-directly-might-be-offensive-insulting-or-threatening">Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, or threatening?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-relate-to-people">Does the dataset relate to people?</h2>
<p>Yes; it contains records relating to police officers in the Chicago Police Department.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-identify-any-subpopulations">Does the dataset identify any subpopulations?</h2>
<p>Yes; officer records include race, gender, age, appointment date, unit history, badge numbers, position title, salary, awards, complaints, and tactical response reports. Subpopulations of officers can be constructed using these fields.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-possible-to-identify-individuals">Is it possible to identify individuals?</h2>
<p>Yes; detailed information is available that could be used to identify individual officers.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-that-might-be-considered-sensitive-in-any-way">Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way?</h2>
<p>The data contains a coarse categorization of racial origins of officers.</p>
<h1 id="collection-process">Collection Process</h1>
<h2 id="how-was-the-data-associated-with-each-instance-acquired">How was the data associated with each instance acquired?</h2>
<p>The raw data were obtained via FOIA requests to the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Department.</p>
<h2 id="what-mechanisms-or-procedures-were-used-to-collect-the-data">What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data?</h2>

It is not known explicitly whether or how either party was compensated.</p>
<h2 id="over-what-timeframe-was-the-data-collected">Over what timeframe was the data collected?</h2>
<p>The earliest releases per FOIA request occurred in 2016, and continue to occur as more FOIA requests are filed. The raw data itself pertain to records from the CPD dating back to the mid 20th century. The roster data covers the period up to 2018. The awards data pertains to records from 1967 to 2019.
