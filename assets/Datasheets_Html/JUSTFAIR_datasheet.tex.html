<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>This dataset was created to increase the ease of access to data on public criminal trials. Specifically, it combines information from the US sentencing commission, Federal judicial center, PACER, wikipedia, and Federal Judicial Center biographies to create a dataset of defendants and their demographic characteristics with information about their crimes, their sentences, and the identity of the sentencing judge <span class="citation" data-cites="ciocanel2020justfair"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The dataset was created by researchers at the Institute for the Quantitative Study of Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity (QSIDE): Maria-Veronica Ciocanel, Chad Topaz, Rebecca Santorella, Shilad Sen, Christian Smith, and Adam Hufstetler.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>The authors wished to determine whether judges with significant sentencing outcome disparities across the race of defendants were due to racial bias by creating a dataset with sufficient controls, such as defendant’s education level or age.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each instance in this dataset corresponds to a single criminal trial sentencing.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />

<p>There are a total of 595,850 sentences in the dataset.</p>

For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>The United States Sentencing Commission maintains publicly accessible data sets, including files which provide information about sentences given to individuals in federal district courts. This dataset contained a subset of these which have been successfully linked with the data from other datasets.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of-if-there-is-a-large-number-of-variables-please-provide-a-broad-description-of-what-is-included.">What data does each instance consist of? <span><br />
If there is a large number of variables, please provide a broad description of what is included.</span></h2>
<p>The JUSTFAIR dataset is a result of linking together five datasets and as a result, it contains many variables. A high-level overview of the available information can be in Figure <a href="#fig:link" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:link">1</a>.</p>
