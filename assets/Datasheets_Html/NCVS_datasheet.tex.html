<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) series was designed to achieve four primary objectives <span class="citation" data-cites="ncvs_data_coodbook"></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime</p></li>
<li><p>To estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to police</p></li>
<li><p>To provide uniform measures of selected types of crime</p></li>
<li><p>To permit comparisons over time and types of areas</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The survey is administered by the U.S. Census Bureau (under the U.S. Department of Commerce) on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (under the U.S. Department of Justice).</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>The NCVS began in 1972 and was developed following a survey done by the National Opinion Research Center and the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice. The survey highlighted that many crimes were not reported to the police. The NCVS was created to assess the levels of and gain better understanding of criminal victimization, including from crimes that were never reported to law enforcement <span class="citation" data-cites="ncvs_data_coodbook"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Instances in NCVS correspond to a record of a criminal victimization incident.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>Yes, there are four types of records:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Address ID Record</p></li>
<li><p>Household Record</p></li>
<li><p>Person Record</p></li>
<li><p>Incident Record</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Each person can have multiple incident records, each household can include several persons.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>Data is collected bi-annually, from a nationally representative sample of <span class="math inline"> ∼ 49, 000</span> households comprising <span class="math inline"> ∼ 100, 000</span> persons on the frequency, characteristics, and consequences of criminal victimization in the United States. The number of incidents will vary from year to year.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set-for-example-if-it-is-traffic-stops-from-a-territory-is-it-all-traffic-stops-conducted-within-that-territory-within-a-specific-time-if-not-is-it-a-representative-sample-of-all-stops-describe-how-representativeness-was-validatedverified.-if-it-is-not-representative-please-describe-why.">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? <span><br />
For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains a sample of 100,000 persons from the United States. Weights are provided at the person, household, and incident level to produce a representative sample of the US <span class="citation" data-cites="ncvs_data_coodbook"></span>. Excluded are persons who are crews of vessels, in institutions (e.g., prisons and nursing homes) or members of the armed forces living in military barracks <span class="citation" data-cites="ncvs_data_coodbook"></span>. Once in the sample, respondents are interviewed every six months for a total of seven interviews over a three-year period.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-a-target-label-or-associated-with-each-instance-please-include-labels-that-are-likely-to-be-used-as-target-labels-e.g.-recidivism.">Is there a target label or associated with each instance? <span><br />
Please include labels that are likely to be used as target labels, e.g. recidivism.</span></h2>
<p>No variable in the dataset is designated as a label. However, whether or not a crime was reported and whether or not an arrest was made following that report may be suitable as target labels <span class="citation" data-cites="fogliato2022validity"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-recommended-data-splits-e.g.-training-developmentvalidation-testing-if-so-please-provide-a-description-of-these-splits-explaining-the-rationale-behind-them.">Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? <span><br />

If so, is it based on the individual’s self-description, or based on officer’s impression? Was it collected or derived in post-processing? For example, by name analysis.</span></h2>
<p>Yes, race and ethnicity are reported for the victim, and sometimes for the offender as well.</p>
<p>For the victim, that is, the survey respondent, race and ethnicity are self-reported. The race categories are: White, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and Other. Only Hispanic ethnicity is recorded.</p>
<p>For the offender, race and ethnicity are perceived and reported by the respondent, i.e., the victim, if they saw the offender. The race categories are: Mostly White, Mostly Black or African American, Mostly American Indian or Alaska Native, Mostly Asian, Mostly Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Equal number of each race, and Don’t Know. The ethnicity categories are: mostly Hispanic or Latino, mostly non-Hispanic, equal number of Hispanic and non-Hispanic, and don’t know.</p>

If so, please provide a description.</span></h2>
<p>Weights are provided on a person, household and incident level to produce a representative sample of the US. Prisoners are excluded from the sample.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-on-criminal-history-or-other-data-that-might-be-considered-confidential-or-sensitive-in-any-way-for-example-sexual-orientations-religious-beliefs-political-opinions-or-union-memberships-or-locations-financial-or-health-data-biometric-or-genetic-data-forms-of-government-identification-such-as-social-security-numbers-if-so-please-provide-a-description.">Does the dataset contain data on criminal history or other data that might be considered confidential or sensitive in any way? <span><br />

For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?</span></h2>
<p>According to the authors of a book chapter on the potential sources of error in the NCVS <span class="citation" data-cites="kruttschnitt2014potential"></span>, there are questions as to whether the rape and sexual assault are underestimated as they do not align with alternative surveys. “The Bureau of Justice Statistics does not provide public information on the edit process in the National Crime Victimization Survey, although processing and editing errors are an important part of any major survey data collection. The lack of transparency about these processes makes it difficult for data users to fully understand the survey’s estimate” <span class="citation" data-cites="kruttschnitt2014potential"></span>.</p>
