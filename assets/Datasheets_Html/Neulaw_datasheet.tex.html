<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>According to the creators of the dataset, the dataset was created “To allow large-scale, cross-jurisdictional analyses of criminal arrests" and ”enhance many types of research – for example, identification of high-frequency offenders, measurement of changes in policing strategies, and quantification of legislative efficacy – giving policy makers the best data upon which to base law enforcement decisions” <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other? </span></h2>
<p>The codebook lists Gabe Haarsma, Sasha Davenport, Pablo A. Ormachea &amp; David M. Eagleman as authors <span class="citation" data-cites="Neulaw"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>The dataset was created to improve on the information available from the UCR SRS program. Specifically, according to the creators, the advantages of this novel dataset include: (1) individual identifiers allow for recidivism analysis—albeit only for repeated bookings within the same jurisdiction (2) the presence of all the charges allows for deeper understanding of all crime, not just a subset, (3) more and different offender-specific variables than the UCR, (4) the data represent a comprehensive and growing picture of information available to judges and prosecutors, and (5) more and different disposition-specific variables, enabling assessment of small variations in punishment <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>

<p><strong>Harris County, TX:</strong> 3.1 million records, spanning from 1977 to April, 2012.<br />
<strong>New York City, NY:</strong> 9.8 million records spanning from 1977 to 2013.<br />
<strong>Miami-Dade County, FL:</strong> 5.7 million records spanning from 1971 to 2012.</p>

For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why. </span></h2>
<p>The dataset includes all records from each jurisdiction, within the stated time frame. Some data instances were removed in pre-processing. In addition:</p>
<p>(1) The database contains no juvenile records, as those are not included in basic Freedom of Information Act requests. We note that juvenile is defined differently in each locale, so 17 year olds are included in Harris County records whereas only 18 year olds appear in New York City and Miami-Dade County records.<br />
(2) The database does not include sealed or expunged records, as those are typically removed from the underlying county databases. It is likely that this disproportionately affects certain crime types (e.g., traffic offenses).</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of-if-there-is-a-large-number-of-variables-please-provide-a-broad-description-of-what-is-included.">What data does each instance consist of? <span><br />
If there is a large number of variables, please provide a broad description of what is included. </span></h2>
<p>In the <strong>Harris County dataset</strong>, each instance contains Information regarding the:<br />
1. Offense: date, code, name, degree, bond amount at the time of arrest, category, broad category.<br />
2. Defendant: unique ID, race, gender, DOB (mm/yyyy), height, weight, citizenship status.<br />
3. Case: unique case ID, date filed, offense degree, case bond, case status.<br />
4. Attorney: hired or assigned. 5. Grand jury: date, defendant present, and jury action code.<br />
6. Disposition: date, plea, disposition (e.g., dismissed).<br />
In the <strong>New York City dataset</strong>, each instance contains Information regarding the:<br />
1. Offense: month, year.<br />
2. Arrest: county, month, year, charge, crime category, broad crime category.<br />
3. Defendant: race, gender, age at arrest.<br />
3. Disposition: county, month, year, charge, disposition.<br />
In the <strong>Miami-Dade County dataset</strong>, each instance contains Information regarding the:<br />
1. Arrest: date, code, crime category, broad crime category.<br />
2. Case: date filed, date closed, offense degree, trial type (Bench / Jury), case code, case status.<br />
3. Defendant: race, gender, DOB (mm/yyyy).<br />
4. Disposition: code, plea, disposition.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-target-label-or-associated-with-each-instance-please-include-labels-that-are-likely-to-be-used-as-target-labels-e.g.-recidivism.">Is there a target label or associated with each instance? <span><br />
Please include labels that are likely to be used as target labels, e.g. recidivism. </span></h2>
<p>There is not a pre-specified target label. However, disposition is most suitable to be used as a target label.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-recommended-data-splits-e.g.-training-developmentvalidation-testing-if-so-please-provide-a-description-of-these-splits-explaining-the-rationale-behind-them.">Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? <span><br />
If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them. </span></h2>
<p>No.</p>

If so, is it based on the individual’s self-description, or based on officer’s impression? Was it collected or derived in post-processing? For example, by name analysis. </span></h2>
<p>Yes. For race, this originates from the raw data and it is not clear whether it is based on the individual’s self-description.</p>
<p>The jurisdictions within the datasets do not identify offenders of Hispanic descent. To obtain a better understanding of the demographics, the creators have estimated the Hispanic population by last name <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-any-known-errors-sources-of-noise-bias-or-missing-data-or-variables-collected-for-only-part-of-the-datasets-if-so-please-provide-a-description.">Are there any known errors, sources of noise, bias or missing data, or variables collected for only part of the datasets? <span><br />
If so, please provide a description. </span></h2>
<p>All the records in the database were originally entered by humans. The creators attempted to fix typographical errors. However, a larger problem is missing data. For example, some fields have become more populated with time. Birth date was not as commonly entered in some of the earlier records from the 1970s and 1980s, but becomes more rigorously entered with time 6 <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<p>The dataset does not contain corrections records, as most states do not consider those public. Therefore, while we know each offender’s sentence at the end of trial or plea bargaining, we cannot know how long an offender actually served <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-on-criminal-history-or-other-data-that-might-be-considered-confidential-or-sensitive-in-any-way-for-example-sexual-orientations-religious-beliefs-political-opinions-or-union-memberships-or-locations-financial-or-health-data-biometric-or-genetic-data-forms-of-government-identification-such-as-social-security-numbers-if-so-please-provide-a-description.">Does the dataset contain data on criminal history or other data that might be considered confidential or sensitive in any way? <span><br />
For example: sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; If so, please provide a description. </span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains partial information on criminal offending, as well as demographic information. The partial criminal offending can be constructed as the dataset contains unique identification numbers that can be linked across multiple offenses in an area. For example, in Harris County, Texas, 44% of the 1.2M uniquely identified offenders have multiple offenses – and therefore a partial record of offense (see Figure <a href="#fig:offense_dist" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:offense_dist">[fig:offense_dist]</a>).</p>

For example: testing predictive policing systems, predicting recidivism. </span></h2>
<p>The dataset can be used for research questions around case disposition and sentencing. A partial criminal record can be constructed from the Harris County dataset.</p>

For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? </span></h2>
<p>The dataset only contains arrest data and not incident-based data, thus providing a picture of crime at the courthouse level. This means that previous stages in the law enforcement process (e.g., 911 calls, house calls, etc.) could skew the arrests that make it into courthouse databases <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<p>The recidivism analysis allowed by this only applies for repeated bookings within the same jurisdiction. This approach will systematically undercount the true recidivism rate due to relocation <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<p>The dataset does not have victim data, precluding the analysis of, for example, whether ethnicity or age of victim affects sentencing <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions have more limited data than the rest. For example, New York City’s records only list the most serious offense per arrest and do not yet include an identifier <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>
<p>While our Broad categorization allows for comparisons across jurisdictions, the detailed categorization does not. The subcategories become populated only if the jurisdictions’ labels or code citations provided enough detail <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>

<p>To acquire the underlying data, the dataset creators “contacted New York City (New York), Harris County (Houston), and MiamiDade County (Miami), to obtain copies of their criminal records from their justice information management systems. As public records, the data were obtained via Freedom of Information Act requests” <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span>.</p>

<p>Yes. Data processing is described is detail in <span class="citation" data-cites="ormachea2015new"></span> and in the codebook <span class="citation" data-cites="Neulaw"></span>. Broadly, the data was cleaned and standardized, and duplicated entries were removed. Entries have been de-identified by removing names, addresses, etc. DOB was replaced with the month and year only. In the Harris County dataset, defendants and cases were given a unique identifiers. The creators added seven calculated variables for all the datasets: 1. Broad crime category (32 categories), 2.
