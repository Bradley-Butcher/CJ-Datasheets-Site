<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The dataset was created to track traffic stops in the United States.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The dataset was created by the Stanford Open Policing Project, a collaboration between the Stanford Computational Journalism Lab and the Stanford Computational Policy Lab. Please see the ‘who we are’ section on the project’s website:<br />
<a href="https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/">https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/</a></p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>Police pulls over more than 50,000 drivers on a typical day, more than 20 million motorists every year. Yet the most common police interaction — the traffic stop — has not been tracked, at least not in any systematic way <span class="citation" data-cites="pierson2020large"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each instance in this dataset represents a single traffic stop.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-e.g.-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
e.g., offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>There are currently over 200 million stops recorded, and this continues to grow.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set-for-example-if-it-is-traffic-stops-from-a-territory-is-it-all-traffic-stops-conducted-within-that-territory-within-a-specific-time-if-not-is-it-a-representative-sample-of-all-stops-please-describe-how-representativeness-was-validatedverified.-if-it-is-not-representative-please-describe-why-not">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? <span><br />
For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? please describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why not</span></h2>
<p>The data is not comprehensive, i.e., not all stops are included, but it contains over 200 million records from the majority of state patrol agencies and over 50 police departments. Data was obtained via public records requests.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of-if-there-is-a-large-number-of-variables-provide-a-broad-description-of-what-is-included">What data does each instance consist of? <span><br />
if there is a large number of variables, provide a broad description of what is included</span></h2>
<p>As the records are collated from many sources, the entire set of variables is not necessarily available for each record. Maximally, each record can contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stop Date</p></li>
<li><p>Stop Time</p></li>
<li><p>Stop Location</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Race</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Sex</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Age</p></li>
<li><p>Search Conducted</p></li>
<li><p>Contraband Found</p></li>
<li><p>Citation Issued</p></li>
<li><p>Warning Issued</p></li>
<li><p>Frisk Performed</p></li>
<li><p>Arrest Made</p></li>
<li><p>Reason for Stop</p></li>
<li><p>Violation</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-there-a-target-label-or-associated-with-each-instance-please-include-labels-that-are-likely-to-be-used-as-target-labels-e.g.-recidivism.">Is there a target label or associated with each instance? <span><br />
Please include labels that are likely to be used as target labels, e.g. recidivism.</span></h2>
<p>No. However, potential target labels are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Citation Issued</p></li>
<li><p>Warning Issued</p></li>
<li><p>Frisk Performed</p></li>
<li><p>Arrest Made</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="are-there-recommended-data-splits-e.g.-training-developmentvalidation-testing-if-so-please-provide-a-description-of-these-splits-explaining-the-rationale-behind-them.">Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? <span><br />
If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.</span></h2>
<p>There are not recommended data splits. However, when splitting the data it is good to keep in mind that this data is aggregated from different sources. For example, one may wish to condition on the source county when creating time-series models. In this case, the data should be split across counties, using earlier years as training data and later years as test data.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-data-on-race-and-ethnicity-if-so-is-it-based-on-the-individuals-self-description-or-based-on-officers-impression-was-it-collected-or-derived-in-post-processing-e.g.-through-name-analysis.">Does the dataset contain data on race and ethnicity? <span><br />
If so, is it based on the individual’s self-description, or based on officer’s impression? Was it collected or derived in post-processing? e.g. through name analysis.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Driver Race</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Sex</p></li>
<li><p>Driver Age</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is unknown if this information is based on self-description or on the officer’s impression, and it can be a mix of both.</p>
<h2 id="sec:errors">Are there any known errors, sources of noise, bias or missing data, or variables collected for only part of the datasets? <span><br />
If so, please provide a description.</span></h2>
<p>The authors list five items:<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Take care when making direct comparisons between locations:</strong> For example, if one state has a far higher consent search rate than another state, that may reflect a difference in search recording policy across states, as opposed to an actual difference in consent search rates.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Examine counts over time in each state:</strong> for example, total numbers of stops and searches by month or year. This will help you find years for which data is very sparse (which you may not want to include in analysis).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not assume that all disparities are due to discrimination:</strong> For example, if young men are more likely to receive citations after being stopped for speeding, this might simply reflect the fact that they are driving faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not assume the standardized data are absolutely clean:</strong> We discovered and corrected numerous errors in the original data, which were often very sparsely documented and changed from year to year, requiring us to make educated guesses. This messy nature of the original data makes it unlikely the cleaned data are perfectly correct.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not read too much into very high stop, search, or other rates in locations with very small populations or numbers of stops</strong>: For example, if a county has only 100 stops of Hispanic drivers, estimates of search rates for Hispanic drivers will be very noisy and hit rates will be even noisier. Similarly, if a county with very few residents has a very large number of stops, it may be that the stops are not of county residents, making stop rate computations misleading.</p></li>

For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?</span></h2>
<p>Other than the high-level issues presented in section <a href="#sec:errors" data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="sec:errors">2.9</a>, individual counties are pre-processed individually. We note that not all variables present in the raw data are provided in this dataset. If you are attempting a local analysis, you can contact the OPP at: open-policing@lists.stanford.edu to obtain the original records.</p>
