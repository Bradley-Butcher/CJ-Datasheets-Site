<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The PIRUS dataset was created to better understand domestic radicalization. The dataset contains information on individuals in the United States that have been radicalized between 1948 and 2018.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The dataset was created by START, the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, a university-based research center, based at the University of Maryland.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>The PIRUS dataset is among the first efforts to understand domestic radicalization from an empirical and scientifically rigorous perspective <span class="citation" data-cites="mcfee2019profiles"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each instance corresponds to a de-identified individual who has been radicalized to violent or non-violent extremism.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>There is data on 2,226 individuals in this dataset.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set-for-example-if-it-is-traffic-stops-from-a-territory-is-it-all-traffic-stops-conducted-within-that-territory-within-a-specific-time-if-not-is-it-a-representative-sample-of-all-stops-describe-how-representativeness-was-validatedverified.-if-it-is-not-representative-please-describe-why.">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? <span><br />
For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>This is a sample of radicalized individuals in the United States. In order to be eligible for inclusion, each individual must meet one of the following five criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The individual was arrested.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual was indicted of a crime.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual was killed as a result of his or her ideological activities.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual is/was a member of a designated terrorist organization.</p></li>
<li><p>The individual was associated with an extremist organization whose leader(s) or founder(s) has/have been indicted of an ideologically motivated violent offense.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In addition, each individual MUST:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Have been radicalized in the United States.</p></li>
<li><p>Have espoused or currently espouse ideological motives.</p></li>
<li><p>Show evidence that his or her behaviors are/were linked to the ideological motives he or she espoused/espouses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, the authors state:</p>
<p>“The PIRUS database is not, and should not be treated as, a comprehensive set of all individuals who have radicalized in the United States. Achieving a comprehensive dataset of all individuals who meet the database’s inclusion criteria remains implausible for several reasons”.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
