<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>“The larger goals of the Pathways study are to improve decision-making by court and social service personnel and to clarify policy debates about alternatives for serious adolescent offenders. We hope to provide juvenile justice professionals and policy-makers with reliable empirical information that can be applied to improve practice, particularly regarding juveniles’ competence and culpability, risk for future offending, and amenability to rehabilitation” <span class="citation" data-cites="pathways_website"></span>.</p>

Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The Pathways to Desistance study grew out of the planning efforts of the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice. Network activities provided the initial forum for conceptualizing and planning this study. Additional funding from an array of both federal and private agencies supported data collection and other study activities <span class="citation" data-cites="pathways_website"></span>.

<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>“The aims of the investigation are to: identify initial patterns of how serious adolescent offenders stop antisocial activity; describe the role of social context and developmental changes in promoting these positive changes; and compare the effects of sanctions and interventions in promoting these changes” <span class="citation" data-cites="pathways_website"></span>.</p>
<p>“Some commentators have questioned whether a separate juvenile justice system is even warranted, given its dismal record at controlling or deterring juvenile crime. This debate is occurring, however, with limited data on either patterns of desistance or escalation among serious adolescent offenders or the effects of interventions and sanctions on trajectories of offending during and after adolescence. Although some studies suggest that most offenders curtail or stop antisocial behavior in late adolescence, this research has relied on very small samples of serious offenders or on very limited measurement of antisocial behavior patterns and developmental change’ <span class="citation" data-cites="pathways_website"></span>.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Interview responses of youth offenders. Each participant was interview multiple times. Each interview is a different data instance.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>Yes. In addition to interview responses, there are official records, e.g. of arrests, and other collateral information to verify the self-reported information.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains information on 1354 serious juvenile offenders. Each participant was followed for a period of seven years, with interviews conducted every 6 months for the first 3 years and every 12 months thereafter.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?</h2>
<p>Enrollment into the Pathways to Desistance study occurred over a twenty-six month period between November, 2000 and January, 2003.<br />
To be eligible for the study, individuals had to be in Maricopa County, AZ or Philadelphia, PA and:<br />
1. at least 14 years old and under 18 years old at the time of their committing offense.<br />
2. found guilty of a serious offense (predominantly felonies, with a few exceptions for some misdemeanor property offenses, sexual assault, or weapons offenses).<br />
3. had to provide informed assent or consent (parent consent was obtained for all youth under the age of 18 at the time of enrollment).<br />
The proportion of male youth found guilty of a drug charge was capped at <span class="math inline">15%</span> to avoid an over-representation of drug offenders. All females who met the age and crime criteria were approached for enrollment as were youth being considered for trial in the adult system. Twenty percent of the youths approached for participation declined <span class="citation" data-cites="pathways_website"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of-if-there-is-a-large-number-of-variables-please-provide-a-broad-description-of-what-is-included.">What data does each instance consist of? <span><br />
If there is a large number of variables, please provide a broad description of what is included.</span></h2>
<p>Interview responses. In addition, official arrest and court records were obtained for each participant. Among other topics, participants were asked about their offending, interactions with the justice system, and alcohol and drug use.</p>
<p>Relevant to criminal justice, participants self-report their levels of offending for various categories. Specifically, participants are asked about the frequency of committing each of the following acts over the past year (first interview) or from the last interview: Destroy property, set fire, broke in to steal, shoplift, receive stolen prop, use credit card illegally, stole car, sold marijuana, sold other drug, carjacked, drove drunk, been paid by someone for sex, forced sex, killed someone, shot someone, shot at someone, robbery with weapon, robbery no weapon, beaten someone, in fight, fight part of gang, carried gun, enter car to steal, gone joyriding.<br />
Data of re-arrests from official records is also reported.</p>
