<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The SPI was created to produce national estimates for the state and sentenced federal prison populations. It aims to provide a record and means of tracking inmate characteristics, such as demographics, background, and criminal history <span class="citation" data-cites="glaze2019methodology"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The dataset was created by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>The dataset was created to be the first national periodic inmate survey in the United States, collecting detailed information pertinent to evolving issues within the criminal justice domain.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each row corresponds to a survey response from a prison inmate.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>There are a total of 24,848 inmates (20,064 state and 4,784 federal prisoners) in the 2016 SPI dataset.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set-for-example-if-it-is-traffic-stops-from-a-territory-is-it-all-traffic-stops-conducted-within-that-territory-within-a-specific-time-if-not-is-it-a-representative-sample-of-all-stops-describe-how-representativeness-was-validatedverified.-if-it-is-not-representative-please-describe-why.">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? <span><br />
For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset is a representative sample of the (over 18) U.S. prison population. Achieved by using a two-stage sample design, where state and federal prisons are selected in the first stage, followed by individuals selected from these facilities in the second stage. Samples are then weighted to account for non-response. Further details can be found in the SIP methodology white paper <span class="citation" data-cites="glaze2019methodology"></span>.</p>

If so, please provide a description.</span></h2>
<p>There are two known potential sources of error/noise: nonresponse (where the demographics of the respondents is significantly different to the non-respondents), and a coverage bias (where the sample population did not represent the target population).
