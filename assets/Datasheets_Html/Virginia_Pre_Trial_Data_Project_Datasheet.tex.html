<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The Virginia State Crime Commission has been studying various aspects of the pre-trial process since 2016. However, there was a significant lack of data readily available to answer many important questions related to the pre-trial process in the Commonwealth. As a result, the Virginia Pre-Trial Data Project was developed <span class="citation" data-cites="codebook"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The project was lead by the Virginia State Crime Commission. Data was collected from the following agencies: Supreme Court of Virginia, Office of the Executive Sectretary; Alexandria Circuit Court; Fairfax County Circuit Court; Virginia Department of Criminal Justice Services; Virginia State Police; Virginia Department of Corrections; Virginia Compensation Board.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>Following individuals from pre-trial to final dispositions, including assigned risk levels. The Project consisted of two phases: (i) developing a cohort of adult defendants charged with a criminal offense in Virginia during October 2017 and (ii) tracking various outcomes within that cohort <span class="citation" data-cites="codebook"></span>.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Each instance reports on a ‘contact event’, defined as: “all charges against a defendant in the same jurisdiction on the same day and having the same CBR number” (CBR stands for “Commit, Bond, Release” and refers to any one of these bail processes) <span class="citation" data-cites="codebook"></span>.</p>
<p>Each instance includes information regarding the defendant, and the progression of the criminal case from the time a defendant is charged with an offense until the final disposition of the case, i.e., trial or sentencing <span class="citation" data-cites="codebook"></span>.</p>
<p>If the same individual has more than one contact event during the month of October 2017, only the earlier contact event is reported in the data. If a defendant was charged with multiple offenses on the same day, but the offenses were heard in different courts, those records were grouped by court and reported as separate events <span class="citation" data-cites="codebook"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains 22,986 adult defendants charged with a criminal offense during a October 2017.</p>
<h2 id="does-the-dataset-contain-all-possible-instances-or-is-it-a-sample-not-necessarily-random-of-instances-from-a-larger-set-for-example-if-it-is-traffic-stops-from-a-territory-is-it-all-traffic-stops-conducted-within-that-territory-within-a-specific-time-if-not-is-it-a-representative-sample-of-all-stops-describe-how-representativeness-was-validatedverified.-if-it-is-not-representative-please-describe-why.">Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? <span><br />
For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>The cohort includes all defendants charged in Virginia in October 2017. However, some instances were excluded from the follow-up and as a result can not be used for most analysis. The reason for the excluding is reported in the variable ‘Exclude’ and include missing data, the defendant being under 18 when they were charged, and the offense not being punishable by incarceration, amongst other reasons.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-does-each-instance-consist-of-if-there-is-a-large-number-of-variables-please-provide-a-broad-description-of-what-is-included.">What data does each instance consist of? <span><br />
If there is a large number of variables, please provide a broad description of what is included.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset contains over 700 variables for each defendant. Broadly, these include:<br />
1. Demographics: Sex, Race, Age, Indigency Status, Virginia Residency Status, Zip Code.<br />
2. Pending charges.<br />
3. State or local probation status.<br />
4. October 2017 charge(s): number of offense, offense and offense type (up to 10).<br />
5. Bond: Bond Type and amount at initial contact and at release.<br />
6. Release status: Whether Defendant Was Released During Pre-trial Period, Pre-Trial Release Date, Pretrial Release Type.<br />
7. Whether the defendant received pretrial services agency supervision: supervision Days, conditions. Whether defendant is on state or community supervision.<br />
8. Case: attorney type, court type, court locality, sentence type, imposed and effective sentence, Final Disposition and disposition date.<br />
9. Prior criminal history: age at first adult arrest; number prior arrests for felonies, misdemeanors, and specific crimes, e.g., domestic abuse; number of prior convictions overall, as an adult, in the past 2 and 5 years, for felonies, misdemeanors, and specific crimes, e.g., drug convictions. Prior sentencing for felonies and probation Revocation ; prior probation revocations, number of prior incarceration events for more than 14 days, less and more than a year.<br />
10: Risk level: components to calculate VPRAI <span class="citation" data-cites="VPRAI"></span> and PSA <span class="citation" data-cites="PSA"></span> risk levels, and corresponding scores.<br />
11. Court appearance and public safety: details on new failure to appear and offending in the follow up period.<br />
12: Aggregate locality characteristics: locality Name, Region, population estimate, density and demographic (race, ethnicity, sex and age combined) composition, unemployment and education rates, number of law enforcement officers, income, health insurance, citizenship status; incident and arrest rate overall and for specific crimes.</p>

Please include labels that are likely to be used as target labels, e.g. recidivism.</span></h2>
<p>There is not pre-specified target label. However, variables under the court appearance and public safety, e.g., new offending, are particularly suitable to be used as target variables.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-recommended-data-splits-e.g.-training-developmentvalidation-testing-if-so-please-provide-a-description-of-these-splits-explaining-the-rationale-behind-them.">Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? <span><br />
