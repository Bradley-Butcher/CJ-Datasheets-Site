<h2 id="for-what-purpose-was-the-dataset-created">For what purpose was the dataset created?</h2>
<p>The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) was created to provide up-to-date information on tobacco, alcohol, and drug use, mental health and other health-related issues in the United States <span class="citation" data-cites="nsduh"></span>.</p>
<p>The data provide estimates of substance use and mental illness at the national, state, and substate levels. NSDUH data also help to identify the extent of substance use and mental illness among different subgroups, estimate trends over time, and determine the need for treatment services <span class="citation" data-cites="nsduh"></span>.</p>
<h2 id="who-created-the-dataset-is-it-an-official-law-enforcement-or-government-body-an-academic-research-team-other">Who created the dataset? <span><br />
Is it an official law enforcement or government body? An academic research team? Other?</span></h2>
<p>The dataset is created by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSA), with data collection and analysis conducted under contract with RTI International.</p>
<h2 id="was-there-a-specific-task-in-mind-or-gap-that-needed-to-be-filled">Was there a specific task in mind, or gap that needed to be filled?</h2>
<p>NSDUH was created to support prevention and treatment programs, monitor substance use trends, estimate the need for treatment and inform public health policy. Prior to NSDUH, there was no annual health survey that reported on substance abuse and other health issues.</p>
<h1 id="composition">Composition</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-the-instances-that-comprise-the-dataset-represent-for-example-crimes-offenders-court-cases-police-officers">What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? <span><br />
For example: crimes, offenders, court cases, police officers</span></h2>
<p>Instances in the dataset comprise of individual survey responses.</p>
<h2 id="are-there-multiple-types-of-instances-for-example-offenders-victims-and-the-relationship-between-them.">Are there multiple types of instances? <span><br />
For example: offenders, victims, and the relationship between them.</span></h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="how-many-instances-are-there-in-total-of-each-type-if-appropriate.">How many instances are there in total? <span><br />
Of each type, if appropriate.</span></h2>
<p>The dataset is released annually, containing information from <span class="math inline"> ∼ 55, 000</span> respondents. 2020 was an exception due to the Covid-19 pandemic, when there were only <span class="math inline"> ∼ 30, 000</span> respondents.</p>

For example, if it is traffic stops from a territory, is it all traffic stops conducted within that territory within a specific time? If not, is it a representative sample of all stops? Describe how representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative, please describe why.</span></h2>
<p>Survey responses are collected from a sample of the population. The target population of the survey is defined as the civilian, noninstitutionalized population of the United States. NSDUH collects information from residents of households and non-institutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories) and from civilians living on military bases. The survey excludes homeless people who do not use shelters, military personnel on active duty, and residents of institutional group quarters, such as jails and hospitals <span class="citation" data-cites="nsduh_method"></span>.</p>

<p>The NSDUH dataset can be used for to investigate questions around drug use and abuse, as well as its relationship to mental health and involvement with the criminal justice system. Age at first use, past-month, annual, and lifetime use is reported for many drugs (listed in a subsequent section), as well as treatment history. The following demographics are also self-reported: age, race, sex, level of education, employment status, income, and veteran status.</p>

If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?</span></h2>
<p>The data is self-reported and is not corroborated in anyway. Although the survey is anonymous, respondents may self-report the amount of drug use or not disclose other details. This may be more prevalent in some demographics compared to others.</p>
<p>Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, collection methodology changed for 2020, making direct comparison to other years difficult.</p>

<p>The data collection methods used for NSDUH to conduct in-person interviews with sampled individuals. Confidentiality is stressed in all written and oral communications with potential respondents. Respondents’ names are not collected with the data, and computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) methods are used to provide a private and confidential setting to complete the interview.</p>
